<font face="Arial" size="4px" color="white">The best way to stop attackers is to think and act like an attacker. Which is why, unlike many security firms, as Africa's leading cybersecurity experts we don’t hire recent grads or people with more experience in IT than security as pen testers. Instead, we find good people who know about bad things. Things like ATM hacking, multi-function printer exploitation, automobile keyless entry attacks, endpoint protection bypass techniques, RFID cloning, security alarm system bypass...you get the idea. And those kinds of people? They’re way more than security experts—they’re bonafide hackers!!

<font face="Arial" size="4px" color="white">This is a security testing service that focuses on locating vulnerabilities, misconfigurations and other flaws in your networks, infrastructure and overall architecture
(i.e. server services, network protocols, operating systems and any other IP enabled components). In this service, we try to exploit vulnerabilities in order to gain full access to vulnerable systems.
In a Network Vulnerability Assessment, which is a cost effective alternative to a Network Penetration Test, we only report on the flaws without actively exploiting them. We leverage the Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM) and the Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) as a foundation for our wireless assessment methodology, which simulates real-world attacks to provide a point-in-time assessment of vulnerabilities and threats to your wireless network infrastructure.

<font face="Arial" size="4px" color="white">More than 70% of all technical attacks are aimed at the Web Application layer. This service examines your web applications from a coding and implementation flaw perspective, but also looks at issues like SQL injection, local and remote file inclusion as well as cross-site-scripting (XSS).It involves the attempts to actively exploit vulnerabilities in order to gain access to the Web Application, underlying database services and hosting server system itself. In a Web Application Vulnerability Assessment, which is a cost effective alternative to a Web Application Penetration Test, we only report on the flaws without actively exploiting them unless permition is granded.In addition to the Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM) and the Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) Hoggervr's application penetration testing service leverages the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), 
a comprehensive framework for assessing the security of web-based applications, as a foundation for our web application assessment methodology.

An employee may simply plug a USB stick in which claims to contain Amazon vouchers, brought their own infected device into the corporate network, clicked on a malicious PDF or simple visited a malware website as he/she thought the email instruction to click on that link came from her manager. Could your staff be tricked that way? Our social engineering services can find out.

As you might know thousands of websites, mobile apps/systems and softwares are developed everyday and hundreds of them get hacked. They loose all the data as well as time and money of both owner viewers or customers.Tomorrow your website might get hacked! We design secure websites, softwares, mobile apps, cloud environments as well as we safeguarding existing websites, systems and all technology infrastrucure as well.</br>
<br>Cybercoding (Offensive Defensive)</br>
We develop Intrusion prevention (IPS) and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) which suite your infrastructure or recommendations on existing setups (incident response automation) and data security(blockchaining). Secure storage of data with appropriate cyptographic concepts e.g. blockchaining. Here at hogger we use blockchaining as one quick solution to datasecurity e.g. we use it for medical records (hospital patient data and in many other critical fields). We develop any cybersecurity tool defensive or offensive cyber weapons.
